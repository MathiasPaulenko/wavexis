Browser automation CLI — wraps [cdpwave](https://pypi.org/project/cdpwave/) and [bidiwave](https://pypi.org/project/bidiwave/).

No Node.js. No Chromium download. Uses your existing Chrome/Edge installation.

## Why wavexis?

wavexis is a command-line tool for browser automation. It wraps the cdpwave (Chrome DevTools Protocol) and bidiwave (WebDriver BiDi) libraries, exposing their capabilities through a single unified CLI. You don't need Node.js, Playwright, or a separate Chromium download — wavexis launches your existing Chrome or Edge installation directly.

### Core concepts

- **Backend** — The browser driver that executes commands. Two backends with full feature parity: CDP (default, via cdpwave) and BiDi (via bidiwave). Switch with `--backend bidi` without losing functionality.
- **Action** — A single operation (screenshot, eval, click, etc.). Each action maps to a CLI command or a step in a multi-action YAML config.
- **Multi-action** — A YAML config that chains multiple actions in sequence on a single browser session. Avoids the overhead of launching a browser per action.
- **Serve mode** — An HTTP API server that exposes all wavexis commands as REST endpoints with WebSocket streaming for real-time events.
- **REPL** — An interactive shell for live browser sessions. Navigate, click, type, and inspect in real time without writing scripts.
- **Init wizard** — An interactive generator that creates `wavexis.yaml` configs from predefined templates for common automation scenarios.

### Key features

- **CLI-first** — screenshot, PDF, eval, scrape from the command line
- **Multi-backend** — CDP (cdpwave) or WebDriver BiDi (bidiwave), switch with `--backend`
- **Full parity** — both backends expose the same public API across 60 CDP domains and 12 BiDi modules (BiDi uses native + JS + CDP bridge)
- **Multi-action** — batch multiple actions from a single YAML config with `--watch` for iterative development
- **Serve mode** — HTTP API server powered by aiohttp
- **Auth profiles** — save and reuse browser credentials
- **Record & replay** — record browser sessions and replay them
- **Interactive REPL** — live browser shell with 16 commands
- **Config wizard** — generate wavexis.yaml from 7 templates interactively
- **CI assertions** — `--assert` flag on `eval` for pass/fail gates with exit codes
- **Performance metrics** — LCP, FCP, CLS, TTFB, CPU traces, profiles, coverage
- **Core Web Vitals scoring** — `cwv` command with LCP/CLS/INP ratings, 0-100 score, and CI budgets
- **Request modification** — intercept and modify requests/responses in-flight via Fetch domain
- **Rate limiting** — token bucket middleware for serve mode with `--rate-limit`
- **Backend degradation** — automatic fallback from preferred backend to next available
- **Console capture** — console messages and browser logs with level filtering
- **Raw protocol** — escape hatch for direct CDP/BiDi commands
- **Action caching** — cache results with `--cache-ttl` to avoid re-analyzing pages
- **Stealth mode** — `--stealth` flag hides headless indicators for scraping protected sites
- **WebExtension management** — install, uninstall, and list browser extensions
- **Browser preferences** — get and set browser prefs programmatically
- **Live event streaming** — WebSocket streaming with `dom_mutation` and `perf_metrics` event types
- **Experimental domains** — WebAuthn, WebAudio, Media, Cast, Bluetooth
- **Fully typed** — `mypy --strict` across the entire codebase
- **MIT licensed** — permissive, compatible with any use

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Chromium) already installed

## Install

```bash
# CDP backend (default, recommended)
pip install wavexis[cdp]

# BiDi backend
pip install wavexis[bidi]

# Serve mode + image extras
pip install wavexis[cdp,serve,image]
```

## Quick start

```bash
wavexis screenshot https://example.com -o out.png
wavexis pdf https://example.com -o out.pdf
wavexis eval https://example.com -e "document.title"
```
